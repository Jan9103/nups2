# File format documentation

Most of the research documented here has not been by me.  
You can find the credits in the main-README.

I put it in here for a few reasons:
* I had to understand code of other complex projects since there was no easily readable documentation.
* If other implementations disapper (many of them contain copyrighted files in their test-framework, etc) this can help.
* I like reading about weird file-formats.

## How to read this

### Data types

* `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`: unsigned (no negative numbers) 8/16/32/64bit number
* `BE` / `LE`: Big / Little endian (weather to read the number left to right or right to left)
